# Telecom-Churn


## Problem Statement

In telecom domain where the customer acquisition has higher cost than customer retention and where there is a rampant price war, it becomes important to predict and profile the customer behavior and predict them so that offers can be rolled out to retain them prior to switching.

Data consist of the various behavior of customers and the last column states if the customer is still with the existing telecom company or not.

## Objective

1. Understand factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Build a churn prediction model.
3. Model evaluation.
4. What can be done to restrict customers from churning.

## Approach

1. Understanding the data provided.
2. Determine the customer behavior on each variable.
3. Find out how churn customers are reacting to each attribute and which are the ones highly impacting churn.
4. Analyze and visualize the data based on the findings.
5. Build a model and validate it on unseen data (test data).
6. Suggest an approach to retain churn customers.

## Strategy

1. Customers with International plan are posing a threat of churn. It was also evident that charges were high for these customers. So a campaign offering freebies along with the plan can be launched to see how these customers perform.
2. Company can keep a track on customers calling Customer care frequently with issues and flag them as churners and solve their issues on priority. Most importantly these issues should not come back to the customers again.
3. Overall charges by the operator were also not satisfactory which was leading to churn. A promotion based on the customer behavior and his/her usage can be launched.

## Conclusion

It is always important to capture the churning customers which is less expensive than acquiring new customers. Churn can affect companyâ€™s overall growth and the reputation also goes down in the market.

Overall the model has given amazing results for the data that was provided. Having said that any model can have improvements based on the data and features available. Though the features provided were good enough to predict churn, additional features viz. month wise data/calls/SMS, monthly revenue of customers, data usage etc. can help us know the behavior of customer. This can help us dig at a minute level and promote campaigns based on customer activities.
